# 🧠 Flownix  
### Intelligent ML Pipelines — Automatically Explained, Optimized, and Ready for Production

Flownix is a **desktop machine learning intelligence engine** that understands your dataset, reasons about the best approach, and generates **clean, production‑ready ML pipelines** — without brute‑force AutoML or manual configuration overload.

Unlike traditional workflow tools, Flownix is **opinionated**, **dataset‑aware**, and **code‑centric**.  
It thinks *before* it trains.

## 🚀 Core Features

### 🔍 1. Dataset Intelligence Engine  
Flownix performs deep structural analysis to understand the dataset before running any ML steps:

- Data health scoring  
- Leakage detection  
- Feature usefulness & noise scoring  
- Class imbalance analysis  
- Correlation traps  
- Overfitting risk detection  
- Dataset size vs model feasibility  

This helps Flownix determine **what is possible**, **what is safe**, and **what should be avoided**.

### 🤖 2. Opinionated ML Decision Engine  
Flownix doesn't give you 100 random models.  
It chooses **the right approach** based on dataset facts:

- Recommends optimal model families  
- Warns when deep learning is unnecessary  
- Suggests feature transformations that matter  
- Highlights features that should be dropped  
- Minimizes compute waste by avoiding impossible models  

This is **senior ML engineer reasoning**, automated.

### 🔧 3. Smart Pipeline Builder (Flow Graph)  
Flownix automatically generates a clean, minimal ML pipeline:

- Preprocessing steps  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training  
- Validation & metrics  
- Export hooks  

The pipeline is shown as a **simple flow graph**, not a cluttered no‑code mess.

### 📦 4. Production‑Ready Code Export  
Every pipeline can be exported as a clean, structured code project:
